##Sales data file 
 -  took the file from Lean excel solutions.

Added new products Product 46 - 50 in the master data sheet and created the sale type entries for these newly added products.

##Preparing, combining both the tables as a new database

created a new tab called 'Final_data'. Copied the whole input data file. Then only the column names from the master data.Named the table as Finaldata.

##Populating Finaldata table.

Filled the Product column using the function 
- =VLOOKUP([@[PRODUCT ID]],MasterData,2)

Filled the category column using the function 
- =VLOOKUP([@[PRODUCT ID]],MasterData,3)

Filled the UOM column using the function 
- =VLOOKUP([@[PRODUCT ID]],MasterData,4)

Filled the Buying price column using the function 
- =VLOOKUP([@[PRODUCT ID]],MasterData,5)

Filled the Selling price column using the function 
- =VLOOKUP([@[PRODUCT ID]],MasterData,6)


##created new calculated field columns - total buy value and total sell value columns

Total buy value  =[@[BUYING PRICE]]*[@QUANTITY]

Total sell value  =[@[SELLING PRICE]]*[@QUANTITY]*(1-[@[DISCOUNT %]]) Then Change number format to number.

##created new columns Day,month and year

Day =DAY([@DATE])
Month =TEXT([@DATE],"MMM")
year =YEAR([@DATE])

##Formatting

Formatted all the price columns to currency $.


##Analysis


Created a new tab called Pivot_Final_data for analysis.

Created the following pivot tables - By Day, By month, By product, By category, By Sale type, By payment type and by Total Sale value.

##Added slicers 

Added slicers for Month, year, payment type, sale type and linked to all the pivot tables by slicer -> report connections.

##Added charts
 Created an area chart for the daily sales.

#Finding Total sales, profit and profit percentage.

total profit = total sell value - total buy value

Profit % = total profit/total buy value

##Adding checkboxes 

Added 3 checkboxes so that we can view the sales per month, profit per month and profit % per month depending whether its checked or not. Created a stacked column chart. Based on the selection in the checkboxes, the graph is displayed.

##Make the by product pivot table dynamic 

Made the product table as dynamic as selecting the month year using slicers can be made possible only if the table is dynamic else it will give error.

To make it dynamic, I used the Offset function 

=OFFSET($R$3,1,0,COUNT($S:$S)) and filled the product, Total sell value and quantity column. 

Now, selecting the month gives you the modified dynamic tbale 'by product'.

##Added Rank 

Added rank for the product based on the total sell value to find the top-most product of the year by using RANK function.

##Added Vlookup function 

Added Vlookup function to get the first ranked product for display in the dashboard.

=VLOOKUP(1,W:Z,2,FALSE)

##Added a table to show the first 10 products

Used the offset function and changed the height in the offset function to 10 to display first 10 products.
=OFFSET($R$3,1,0,10)

Created a bar chart for the same.

##created scroll bar

created a scroll bar to display the 10 products each time you scroll up/down. Also changed the rows in the offset function to the output of the scrolling bar for the product display accordingly.

##Finding the top selling product

Created the same category wise table using offset function
=OFFSET($AH$3,1,0,COUNT($AI:$AI))

created Rank function =RANK(AM4,$AM$4#) to get the order of the most selling product.

From this newly created table, insert a tree map chart.

##created sale type pivot and chart

created a sale type pivot table and inserted a pie chart for the same.

##created payment type pivot and chart

created a payment type pivot table and inserted a pie chart for the same.

##Created dynamic dashboard

I created a dynamic dashboard in a new tab. Arranged everything accordingly and voila..

It's ready to view...so COOL
